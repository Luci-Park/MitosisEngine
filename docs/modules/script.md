# script

Embeds Lua as the gameplay scripting layer, through sol2 over LuaJIT. A script
reads per-frame ECS state and drives triggers, entity behaviour and UI logic. It
does not touch physics, flight dynamics or rendering.

## Model

Exposing a new native component to Lua costs no new binding code. This module is
the main consumer of `core`'s `ComponentRegistry` and `FieldDesc` name erasure,
which was built for exactly this. Scripts reach components by name, so the
bindings never mention a C++ component type.

There are two lifetimes, kept separate.

**Code** is one Lua table per loaded script *name*, holding only the functions
that script defines — `OnStart`, `OnUpdate`, `OnStop` and `NewInstanceData`. It
is shared across every entity running that script.

**State** is one small private table per `instanceRef`, passed as `self` to every
callback.

`ScriptRef` is a POD component carrying `instanceRef`, `started` and
`scriptName`, and it is the only thing the ECS knows about a script.

`ScriptSystem` is the sole driver. It is one `ISystem` in
`SystemPhase::PreUpdate` walking `Query<ScriptRef>`, calling `OnStart` once and
then `OnUpdate` every frame. Each entity's callback is isolated from the others
by a C++ `try`/`catch` and by sol2's `protected_function`, so a script error
stops that entity's script rather than the frame.

```cpp
const AssetId id = MakeAssetId("games/HelloWorld/assets/scripts/spin.lua");
const AssetBlobView *blob = app.Assets()->Load(id);

app.Scripts().LoadScriptSource("spin", AsStringView(*blob));
app.ScriptReload().Track("spin", id);          // picks up an edit on the next cook

const int32_t instance = app.Scripts().CreateInstance("spin");
world.AddComponent<ScriptRef>(entity, ScriptRef{.instanceRef = instance});
```

```lua
local Spin = {}
local speed = 1.0

function Spin.NewInstanceData()
    return { angle = 0.0 }              -- per-instance; never shared
end

function Spin.OnUpdate(self, world, entity, dt)
    self.angle = self.angle + speed * dt
    local half = self.angle * 0.5
    world:set(entity, "Transform", "rotation", { w = math.cos(half), x = 0.0, y = math.sin(half), z = 0.0 })
end

return Spin
```

## API

| Type | Header | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `IScriptHost` | `script/IScriptHost.h` | The abstract seam — the only thing outside `script/src` should depend on |
| `ScriptHost` | `script/ScriptHost.h` | The one Lua-backed implementation; sol2 hidden behind a pimpl |
| `ScriptRef` | `script/components/ScriptRef.h` | POD link component: `instanceRef`, `started`, `scriptName` |
| `ScriptSystem` | `script/ScriptSystem.h` | Drives the callbacks per `ScriptRef`, `SystemPhase::PreUpdate` |
| `ScriptReloadWatcher` | `script/ScriptReloadWatcher.h` | Polls a tracked script's cooked file and reloads on change |
| `RegisterScriptComponents` | `script/ComponentRegistration.h` | Registers `ScriptRef`, mirroring `core` and `renderer` |

The Lua surface — `world:has/get/set/spawn/destroy/add/remove/each/declare` and
the `Entity` usertype — lives in `src/script/bindings/` and is not public. Loaded
Lua source reaches it; no C++ outside this module includes it.

## Rules

**Script state never lives in a component.** Components stay POD, so a script's
data lives in the host's instance map, addressed by `instanceRef`.

**Instance state comes from `NewInstanceData()`, never from copying a template
table.** Lua's `{}` literal already gives every instance an independent copy of
any nested table, and a C++-side shallow copy could not do that without
reimplementing a deep copy.

**Callbacks are re-resolved from the code map on every call**, rather than cached
at instance creation. That is what makes a hot-reload reach an already-running
entity on its very next tick, instead of only entities created after the reload.

**Every Lua callback goes through `sol::protected_function`**, never a raw call.
Otherwise a script's runtime error unwinds through C++ frames via Lua's own error
path instead of surfacing as a checked, loggable result. This was verified under
LuaJIT specifically, not assumed to carry over from plain Lua.

**Every structural change a script makes is mid-walk, by construction.**
`ScriptSystem` always calls into Lua from inside its own `ForEach`, so there is
no "outside a walk" case for a script to be in. The bindings route through
`core`'s `DeferredAccess.h` unconditionally rather than trying to detect which
case they are in.

**`ScriptSystem` installs a `World::AddDestroyHook` and removes it in `OnStop`.**
A hook left behind calls into freed memory on the next entity destroyed. That
pairing is covered by `modules/core/tests/System.tests.cpp`, not by a test here.

**Register native components before loading any script**, including
`RegisterScriptComponents`. `ComponentRegistry` refuses a script that claims an
already-native name, so a script loaded first would win the name instead.

**`Entity` crosses the boundary as a `sol::usertype<Entity>`, never a packed
integer.** A Lua number is a double and exact only to 53 bits, so a packed
`{generation, index}` handle can silently truncate `generation` once a slot has
been reused enough times.

**`FieldKind::Int` accepts any Lua number**, tested with `get_type() ==
sol::type::number` rather than `is<int32_t>()`. That check's strictness is
coupled to the Lua version, and neither variant of it means "is this usable as an
int".

**`world:each`'s `RuntimeQuery` is cached per term list, as a `World` resource**,
so its lifetime matches the `World`'s. A process-wide cache could alias a reused
heap address across `World` instances, between Catch2 test cases for example.

**`OnStart` and an entity's first `OnUpdate` run in the same `PreUpdate` pass**,
before that phase's flush. A deferred `world:add` issued in `OnStart` is
therefore still pending at the first `OnUpdate`, and becomes visible from the
second.

**LuaJIT was measured, not assumed.** On this build, recursive `fib(32)` is 2.7x
faster than plain Lua, and a 50M-iteration `sin`/`cos` loop is 5.0x faster. The
two benchmarks bracket LuaJIT's bias toward loops over deep recursion.

LuaJIT has no CMake config package, only a `.pc` file, so it is found through
`pkg_check_modules(... IMPORTED_TARGET luajit)`. sol2 detects it via
`LUAJIT_VERSION` in its own headers, so nothing else in this module changed for
the swap.

**The reload poll is a plain accumulator at about one second, not a filesystem
watch.** Nothing else in the engine has async or watch infrastructure to build one
on, and re-running a chunk is cheap enough that polling costs nothing noticeable.

## State

*As of 2026-09-06.* Working: embedding, the full ECS binding, per-entity instance
dispatch with isolated errors and independent state, `CommandBuffer`-deferred
structural changes, and mtime-poll hot reload. All of it has been exercised end
to end against the running app. LuaJIT is the shipped backend.

Tests: `modules/script/tests/WorldBindings.tests.cpp`. Much of the rest was
verified by hand rather than automated — independent per-entity state, a live
edit reaching a running instance, and a deliberate error thrown from inside a
`world:each` callback being caught and logged.

`ScriptRef.scriptName` exists so scene files can round-trip which script an
entity runs. `instanceRef` is this run's live state and is deliberately not
saved. Resolving the name back into an `instanceRef` after a scene load is a
manual pass in `main.cpp`, `ResolveSceneScripts`, rather than something this
module or `scene` does.

## Backlog

1. **Cover the hand-verified behaviour.** `ScriptHost` and `ScriptSystem` need
   only a bare `World` and a `sol::state` — no window, no renderer. Binding
   round-trips, per-instance isolation, a deferred mutation issued from inside a
   callback, and the `Entity`-as-userdata precision case are all candidates.
2. **A home for `ResolveSceneScripts` and `ResolveSceneMeshes`**, once a second
   consumer would otherwise duplicate them.
3. **`world:each` builds a fresh Lua table per matched entity per term, every
   call**, even though the `RuntimeQuery` itself is now cached. Whether that
   allocation is worth avoiding is unmeasured.
4. **No script-facing default for a native component's field**, the way
   `NewInstanceData()` gives one for a script's own state. `world:add` with no
   fields table uses whatever `ComponentOps` registered, which is a C++-side
   decision a script cannot override per call site.
5. Confirm the LuaJIT and plain-Lua swap stays a `vcpkg.json` entry plus one
   CMake block, across a future sol2 upgrade that changes how it detects the
   flavour underneath.

## Changed

*2026-09-05* — **Asset copying was fixed to run on an asset-only change.** Was: a
`POST_BUILD` command in `cmake/Assets.cmake` that shared its target's up-to-date
check, so ninja skipped the copy whenever nothing needed relinking. A script edit
would cook fine and then never reach the running executable's `cooked/`
directory, which made hot reload look broken. Now: a separate `OUTPUT`-based
custom command keyed off the cook stamp.

`Shaders.cmake` and `Fonts.cmake` still use the old pattern and probably have the
same gap.
